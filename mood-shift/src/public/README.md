# Homework Helper

## Motivation for the project-
Some of the best solving methods are hidden to common users or requires more of a archaic method of doing so. I watched a lot of people struggle with problem solving and keeping people focused. The purpose of this project is to keep people on task all while making the task easier at the same time.

## Walk through the app with screen shots

You can start by searching any math or science related question or general searches here:

Then your search results will generate into this field:

Which would generate a result that would look something similar to this if your had a math problem:

Then off to the right of the screen you'll notice a small instruction. When you type out the form below that looks like this:

Once you pin your rephrasing of the problem. Then you'll notice that it is now pinned where the small instruction list is at here:

You'll notice that the additional questions on the form will populate, as well as your problem that you rephrased. You can actively change anything on the form and re-pin it so you can always see your problem that you're working through at that time.
